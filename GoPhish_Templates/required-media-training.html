<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our media presence and improve our communications with clients and stakeholders, we have scheduled a mandatory media training exercise for all employees. This training session will help us develop our skills and knowledge in media communication and equip us to better handle media interactions effectively.</p>

<p>To ensure that we are able to tailor this training to your specific needs, we kindly request that you log in to the training portal and fill out a brief survey about your current media skills and experience. This survey will help us design a training session that is relevant and valuable to you.</p>

<p>Please note that attendance is mandatory for all employees, and failure to attend the training session may result in disciplinary action. The training session is scheduled for Monday, March 6th at 12:00 PM EST, and the attached calendar invite includes other pertinent details.
